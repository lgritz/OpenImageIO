**PLEASE DO NOT REPORT BUILD TROUBLES AS GITHUB "ISSUES" UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY
SURE IT'S A BUG**

The best way to get help with your build problems is to ask a question on the
[oiio-dev developer mail list](https://lists.aswf.io/g/oiio-dev) or on the
[ASWF Slack](https://slack.aswf.io) `#openimageio` channel.

When you email about this, please attach one or both of the following:
1. The full verbose build log, which you can create like this:
   ```make clean ; make VERBOSE=1 > build.log```
2. The `CMakeCache.txt` file from your build directory.

If you are pretty sure that you have identified a **BUG** in the OpenImageIO
build scripts, please file a [bug report issue](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenImageIO/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).
